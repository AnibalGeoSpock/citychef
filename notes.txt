pops needed for ABMs, made from samples
curse of dims
smoothing aka not sampling
zero sampling
VAE compared to trad models: Gibbs and Bayesian net
VAEs learn underlying joint probabilities in high dimensional data
VAE (specifically Dl) can be extended to better accomodate spatial, graph and sequential popukation characteristics (ie locations, networks and activity plans)
